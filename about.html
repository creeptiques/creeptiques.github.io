You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Work that paint. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.</p>
