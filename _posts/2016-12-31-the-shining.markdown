Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.

The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Brown is such a nice color.

And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.

Only eight colors that you need. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Don't fight it, use what happens.

You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Use your imagination, let it go. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.

Just use the old one inch brush. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Take your time. Speed will come later. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.
