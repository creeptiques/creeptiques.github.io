We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.

Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Don't be bashful drop me a line. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Let's have a nice tree right here. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.

I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. See there how easy that is. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.

I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. In your world you have total and absolute power.

Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.

You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Let all these things just sort of happen. In this world, everything can be happy. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. See there, told you that would be easy.

Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Just make a decision and let it go. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Let that brush dance around there and play. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.


It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.
